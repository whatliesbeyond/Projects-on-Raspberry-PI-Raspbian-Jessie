Making Raspberry Pi's (RPi's) IP static on a Raspbian Jessie OS using OS X and then SSH through OS X machine to Pi. 
Prerequisites:- 
  A) Raspbian Jessie ported to the Pi
  B) RPi conneceted to the internet through LAN cable 
  C) Your machine connected to the same network

The procedure differs a little than the previous methods where we could just add the IP of our choice to interfaces file in /etc/network. 
On Raspbian Jessie, you need to add the changes to dhchcp.conf in /etc. 

From the terminal:-
  $ cd /etc
  $ nano dhcpcd.conf 
    This should open up the dhcpcd.conf file, where you edit it to add a few lines to the end as mentioned below-
    
    static interface eth0 
		static ip_address=Pi's current IP
		static routers=IP of your router  
		static domain_name_servers=IP of your DNS server
	
	For my mac, Router IP and DNS server IP are both the same.
